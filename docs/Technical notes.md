### Physic Space Algo

```
for d in _dynamics
	for s in statics
		if(collision)
			add s to collisions
		for c in collosions
			if collision
				resolve collision
				call resolution again // to check the corrected vector 
for d in _dynamics 
	dynamuc update positons

for d in dynamics
	for r in _dynamics
		coll detection
	for r in _statics
		coll detection

```

Complexity of the update algo
* d = nb_dynamics
* s = nb_statics

d*s + c*s resolution
d update position
d * s+d collisiont resolution
